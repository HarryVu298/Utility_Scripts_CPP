# Utility_Scripts_CPP

This repository consists of C++ programs that cater to a variety of challenges:

## Contents:

1. **Password Verifier (`passwordRequirement.cpp`)**
    - Validates user-generated passwords to ensure they meet specific requirements like having a minimum length, containing a letter, number, and a special character.
    - Changes include adjusting minimum length, refining the verification process, and outputting a clear status.

2. **Power of Two Checker (`powerOfTwo.cpp`)**
    - Determines if a given number is a power of 2 using bitwise operations.
    - Adjustments have been made for clarity and accuracy, ensuring even edge cases like 0 are properly addressed.

3. **U.S. Income Tax Calculator (`incomeTaxForm.cpp`)**
    - Computes the U.S. income tax owed based on various input parameters such as wages, taxable interest, unemployment compensation, marital status, and taxes withheld.
    - The program calculates the Adjusted Gross Income (AGI), deductions, taxable income, and determines whether tax is owed or a refund is due.
